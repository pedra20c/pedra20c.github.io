	 		<p>YouGov conducted a poll in September 2016 with 1,000 participants asking men, women, of different ages, regions, etc. how often they wash their sheets. The results indicate that while most of those surveyed followed the recommended sheet washing guidelines, men wash their sheets less frequently than women and those under 30 wash their sheets less.

	 		<p> Only 13% of men and women under the age of 30 wash their sheets once a week. When considering the gender gap 41% of the women surveyed wash their sheets once a week or more compared to 30% of men.</p>

	 		<p> The recommended guidelines for sheet washing vary, but amongst experts the consensus is 1-2 weeks. Founder and head coach of a home organizing company Maeves Method, Maeve Richmond reported during an interview with the Huffington Post that washing bed sheets every 1-2 weeks is recommended. Richmond states that it depends on the persons habits, for example if they shower before bed they, sleep with pets, go straight to bed after a workout, etc. CNN.com suggest a similar guideline stating sheets should be washed once a week to “remove a buildup of debris, dust, sweat and other icky things.” Mary Seitler of Whirlpools Institute of Home Science suggest once a week because of dust mites and other allergens.</p>

	 		<p> Perhaps one of the most well-known cases of ignoring the guidelines is that of JD Harmeyer from the Howard Stern show. In November 2015, Harmeyer admitted to not washing his sheets “in over a year.” The comment caused the crew to make fun of him and launched a wave of parody music as well as a @jdbedsheets twitter account. When approached for comment considering the data, Harmeyer didn’t have a comment; however, his colleague Benjy Bronk said via Twitter that sheet washing is “a waste of time, real men sleep on a bare mattress like Ben Franklin did, like Einstein did, like Ghandi did.” Its worth noting Bronk’s comment is historically inaccurate as bed sheets were first used in the 15th century and were common practice by the time Ghandi, Einstein, and Franklin were born, that being said it may provide some insight into the mind of JD Harmeyer and the 5% of the population surveyed who washes their sheets every 7 weeks or less often. </p>
