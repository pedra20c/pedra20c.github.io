	 	<p> <h2> Research indicates that millennials and Latino voters will be playing a role larger than ever in the upcoming elections.</h2> </p>

	 		<p>In the 2016 election both major candidates have been catering to the baby boomer generation by focusing on topics of illegal immigration and national security, but research shows that they should start paying attention to Latino Millennials.
			</p>
	 		
	 		<p> Millennial voters eligible to vote are now nearly equal to that of the baby boomers according to the Pew Research Center, and 32% of that population is Latino/Hispanic.  The National Association of Latino Elected Officials Educational Fund (NALEO) projects that 13.1 million Hispanics will be voting in the election this November and young people represent about 40% of that Hispanic voter population. </p>

	 		<p> Experts have speculated over what kind of impact this will have on upcoming elections, one being potential shifts in the issues important to the community.</p>

	 		<p> Many experts agree the population is pivotal in the upcoming election but Pew Research reported that “the impact of the Latino vote on the presidential race is lessened by the fact that more than half (52%) of all Latino eligible voters live in the non-battleground states of California, Texas, and New York”; however, they also identified that three states in particular may be contested in the upcoming election due to their significant Latino presence. These include Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Another factor according to the same Pew Research Center study, is that voter turnouts amongst Millennials is currently lower than other generations at 46%.</p>

	 		<p> According to the Child Trends Data Bank voting among young adults in the presidential election has steadily declined since 1972. The New Millennium Report issued by the National Association of Secretaries of State in order to account for this decline found that the youth believes that government and elections are not relevant to things they care about. Millennial Sunset Park, Brooklyn resident Jason Ortega, 27, will be voting for the first time this year and said he hadn’t voted before because “behind the curtains, it’s basically an elite group running things so I’m like, why would I vote?”</p>

	 		<p> Janet Hernandez the Senior Civic Engagement Project Manager of the National Council of La Raza spoke to what candidates need to do to address this issue. “Para que la comunidad participle en numeros grandes, los partidos politicos tienen que ir a nuestras comunidades y presenter sus propuestas” said Hernandez. Currently the presidential candidates Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton have aimed to gain support in these communities through their campaign trail stops as well as social media campaigns. Clinton in particular has been active in her outreach, one example being her verified Twitter page @Hillary_esp which has over seventy-six thousand followers and has sent over 1,300 tweets in Spanish. She also retweets many of these in her @HillaryClinton account which has over 10 million followers. </p>

	 		<p> A twitter search using key words such as Latino, Hispanic, Millennials, illegal, and undocumented, revealed that @realDonaldTrump has tweeted significantly less addressing the Latino population (less than 40 tweets with those keywords) but he has addressed the issue of safety on the campaign trail and has one tweet addressing other issues to his 12 million plus followers. </p>

	 		<p> Whether the candidate’s messages are connecting with the communities remains to be seen; however, some Millennials remain ambivalent. “This has all been a TV drama, not because of the media coverage but because both candidates have had their dirty little secrets from the past. That’s why I’m looking for more facts before I go [vote]” says Kent Lei, 28, who supports Trump and is a resident of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Leslie Genao, 20, is a resident of Corona, Queens who will be voting for Clinton when she casts her first ballot come November 8th but she also echoed a disconnect with her candidate. “The elections are crazy for sure. I feel like it’s a joke in a way. I was thinking about not voting but I don’t want Trump to win” says Genoa. </p>
